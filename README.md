## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**:
   - User connects wallet and authenticates
   - User interacts with the AI assistant through natural language
   - User uploads screenshots or charts for analysis

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - AI processes user input and determines intent
   - On-chain data is fetched and analyzed
   - Risk assessment is performed on tokens
   - Trading strategies are created and backtested

3. **Smart Contract Integration**:
   - Token tracking and risk assessment on-chain
   - Strategy execution through smart contracts
   - Transaction optimization for MEV protection

4. **Response Generation**:
   - AI generates natural language responses
   - Visual feedback is provided for analysis
   - Educational content is delivered based on context
