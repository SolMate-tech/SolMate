## Version 1.0.3 - LLM Integration Enhancements

### Overview

This release substantially improves the LLM (Large Language Model) capabilities of the SolMate platform. We've added support for multiple LLM providers, enhanced security for API keys, implemented response caching, and added model comparison features. These improvements allow users to customize their AI assistant experience and help developers evaluate different language models.

### Key Features

#### Enhanced LLM Provider Support

- **Multi-Provider Integration**: Added support for OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Llama, and Mistral AI.
- **Model Selection**: Users can select specific models from each provider (e.g., GPT-4, Claude-3, Llama-3).
- **Custom API Keys**: Users can provide their own API keys for any supported provider.
- **Provider Settings**: Preferences are stored securely in the user profile.

#### Security Enhancements

- **API Key Encryption**: User API keys are now encrypted in the database using AES-256-CBC encryption.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Added admin role support for accessing monitoring endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented tiered rate limits for different API endpoints.

#### Performance Optimization

- **Response Caching**: Added an in-memory cache for LLM responses to reduce redundant API calls.
- **Cache Controls**: Cache supports TTL (time-to-live) settings and maximum size constraints.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times, cache hit rates, and error rates.

#### Developer Tools

- **Model Comparison**: New tool for comparing responses from different models side-by-side.
- **System Monitoring**: Admin endpoints for tracking LLM usage and performance metrics.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all new endpoints.

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Backend Changes

1. **LLM Controller Integration**:
   - Integrated with existing `LLMService` and `ResponseManagerService`
   - Added provider agnostic message handling
   - Implemented cached response handling

2. **Security Layers**:
   - Added encryption service for secure API key storage
   - Implemented admin middleware for protected routes
   - Added role field to User model

3. **Caching Mechanism**:
   - Created a dedicated cache service with TTL support
   - Added cache invalidation policies
   - Implemented cache monitoring and management endpoints

4. **Admin Dashboard Data**:
   - Added aggregation pipelines for provider and model usage statistics
   - Implemented system stats collection
   - Created cache management endpoints

#### Frontend Changes

1. **LLM Provider Selector**:
   - UI for selecting providers and models
   - API key management interface
   - Current settings display

2. **Model Comparison Tool**:
   - Interface for comparing multiple models
   - Response time metrics display
   - Side-by-side response comparison

3. **Settings Integration**:
   - Added new tabs in settings page
   - Created dedicated sections for AI model configuration
   - Added model comparison tools

### API Endpoints

#### LLM Management
- `GET /api/llm/providers` - Get available LLM providers and models
- `GET /api/llm/preferences` - Get user's LLM preferences
- `POST /api/llm/preferences` - Update user's LLM preferences
- `POST /api/llm/message` - Send message to selected LLM provider
- `POST /api/llm/compare` - Compare responses from multiple models

#### Administration
- `GET /api/admin/stats` - Get system usage statistics (admin only)
- `POST /api/admin/cache/clear` - Clear the LLM response cache (admin only)

### Future Improvements

- Stream responses for longer outputs
- Add multimodal support (images, audio)
- Implement fine-tuning capabilities
- Add cost tracking and budget management
- Develop AI agent workflows with specialized providers
